      "- **Account and Ordering Issues**: There are instances where customers face challenges when ordering as guests or when trying to utilize specific account features, such as tax benefits. Streamlining the ordering process and providing clearer instructions could help mitigate these issues.\n",

      "- **Technical Support**: Several users sought assistance with technical problems, such as issues with phone cameras, flashlights, and printing. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive technical support to customers.\n",

      "- **Communication and Transparency**: Some customers expressed frustration due to a lack of communication or transparency, such as flight delays without explanation. Improving communication strategies could enhance customer satisfaction.\n",
